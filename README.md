# JRubyCursus

Partial implementation of the Ruby cursus library developed to run with 
jRuby and Java/Swing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jruby_cursus'
```

And then execute:

```console
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```console
$ gem install jruby_cursus
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'cursus'
```
   
Then use the cusus' APIs with the hope it is implemented...

The gem name is "jruby_cursus" but the client code requires "cursus" so 
that it can the code is compatible with RMI native cursus.
